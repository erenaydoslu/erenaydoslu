# Hi there, I'm Eren Aydoslu! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Artificial Intelligence Master's graduate from TU Delft with a strong foundation in **machine learning**, **data analysis**, and **software development**. My journey has taken me through diverse projects, from building robust machine learning pipelines to developing mobile applications and optimizing wind farm dynamics using cutting-edge AI techniques.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, TypeScript, SQL
- **Technologies**: PyTorch, Pandas, Numpy, Docker, Linux, React Native, CI/CD, DevOps/MLOps
- **Machine Learning**: Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Bayesian Statistics, Causal Inference
- **Soft Skills**: Analytical Thinking, Problem-Solving, Team Communication

## üöÄ Projects

- **Smart Wind Farm Optimization**: Developed a wind flow prediction model using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and implemented reinforcement learning for dynamic yaw angle optimization in turbines. Repo: https://github.com/erenaydoslu/AI2P-WindFarmControl
- **Release Engineering for ML Applications**: Built a multi-service ML pipeline with automated deployments using Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD practices. Repo: https://github.com/erenaydoslu/MLOps-Project
- **Social Media App Development**: Leading the development of a React Native app with a Supabase backend, managing both frontend and backend components, and collaborating with a diverse team.

## üå± Master Thesis

I explored spike time sensitivity in **spiking neural networks**, focusing on the effect of sample difficulty.
