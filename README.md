# Hi there, I'm Eren Aydoslu! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Artificial Intelligence Master's student at TU Delft with a strong foundation in **machine learning**, **data analysis**, and **software development**. My journey has taken me through diverse projects, from building robust machine learning pipelines to developing mobile applications and optimizing wind farm dynamics using cutting-edge AI techniques.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, TypeScript, SQL
- **Technologies**: React Native, Docker, Linux, CI/CD, DevOps/MLOps
- **Machine Learning**: Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Bayesian Statistics, Causal Inference
- **Soft Skills**: Analytical Thinking, Problem-Solving, Team Communication

## üöÄ Projects

- **Smart Wind Farm Optimization**: Developed a wind flow prediction model using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and implemented reinforcement learning for dynamic yaw angle optimization in turbines.
- **Quantitative Research on Sociophysics**: Created regression models to analyze the relationship between Reddit sentiment and stock market behavior, utilizing psychological theories and deep learning techniques.
- **Release Engineering for ML Applications**: Built a multi-service ML pipeline with automated deployments using Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD practices.
- **Social Media App Development**: Leading the development of a React Native app with a Supabase backend, managing both frontend and backend components, and collaborating with a diverse team.

## üå± Currently Learning

I'm exploring advanced topics in **spiking neural networks**, focusing on their sensitivity to sample difficulty.
